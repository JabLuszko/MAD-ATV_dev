Get a USB thumbdrive/pendrive, format it `FAT (Default)`[1].

Create directories `magisk_modules`, `apk` and `scripts`.

Download [PlayIntegrityFix_v14.2.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JabLuszko/MAD-ATV_dev/main/PlayIntegrityFix_v14.2.zip "PlayIntegrityFix_v14.2.zip") into `magisk_modules` directory, do not unpack it - whole zip.

Download [01MAD.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JabLuszko/MAD-ATV_dev/main/01MAD.sh "01MAD.sh") into `scripts` directory.

Download `mad_autoconf.txt` from MADMin -> System -> Auto-Config and put it root/main/not-in-directory.

Optionally! Download [PogoDroid_async.apk](https://www.maddev.eu/apk/PogoDroid_async.apk "PogoDroid_async.apk") and supported/the one you have in Wizard [POGO (not Ares/Samsung and not Split) arm64-v8a apk](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/niantic-inc/pokemon-go/ "POGO") into `apk` directory[2].


Flash [delay_PoGoRom v1.5 A9 x64 S905W ADBUSB](https://github.com/JabLuszko/MAD-ATV_dev/releases/tag/delay) like normally via USB Burning Tool (do not use any extra scripts/configurations/csv's from that ATVROM) and before first boot put the USB thumbdrive/pendrive into the *other* USB PORT.
> [!TIP]
> If you can't open ZIP archives or they seems to error out please check the provided MD5SUMS and if it's matches then file was downloaded properly, your system archiver program can't handle that - install `7z` or `â€ŽThe Unarchiver` for MacOS. If checksums do not match redownload

After like 3 restarts (30 minutes or so?) you should have new device pending in `Auto-Config` - click the IP, select what already existing device you are updating and Auto-Config should take care of rest.

Give it another 20 minutes and one or two restarts to have avatar/player moving.



DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING ON SCREEN/DEVICE/ADB. EVEN IF YOU THINK IT'S STUCK. YES, DON'T TOUCH.


WHOLE GOOGLE ACCOUNT ROUTINE WAS STRIPPED OUT, NO GOOGLE ACCOUNTS, PTC ONLY - I don't think many people left with Google Accounts, but if anyone up for it could be extra script and/or personal_commands MADMin job?



[1] - other filesystems most likely works too, but not tested, just don't go something crazy like exFAT or btrfs.

[2] - RGC need systemize, was too lazy to change that for first iteration so RGC will be downloaded from MAD/Auto-Config.
